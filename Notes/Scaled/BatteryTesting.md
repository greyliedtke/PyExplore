# Calfire Battery Testing


## Instrumentation
- breaker
- t-slot box
  

## Process
1. Charge each pack to 102.4V using the HV PSU (3.20Vpc)
2. Build a frame to hold the battery packs.
3. Electrically connect the three packs in series using AWG-2 wire
4. Connect the packs to a 125A 500V 2-pole breaker. This is the electrical interface for the assembled battery.

## Acceptance Testing

1. Charge to 113.6v
   - charging specs?
   - 
2. Discharge to 91.2v 
    - should be at .3 C which is 30 amps
    - put 3.3 ohms across battery to Discharge
    - measure voltage and current through process.
      - utilize load bank board
