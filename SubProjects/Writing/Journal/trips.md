### Things

Spy museum - Cool gadgets and appreciation for todays technology though. Many people have given lives to deceit and covert operations which was cool. definitely pretty gimicky

Joe very generous with meals, hotel, icy hot. Good energy, planning oriented and happiness from making others happy. Jura quiet, but very nice. Language barrier is tough. Pan cool, cares a lot about girlfriend, fun playing hacky sack.

Bus game of 7

National archives cool sports exhibit and stumbled into constitution lol

Natural history museum. Small humans and beauty of nature

Arlington cemetery. Massive and changing of guard interesting

Lincoln memorial and Washington monument grandiose

Fun speaking and understanding Thai with family. Motivated to really learn it.

### Food

Indian chipotle

Thai restaurant

Impressive public transit service. People generally friendly. Homeless situation much better. Free exhibits and cleanliness just creates such a better vibe.

Being with Jeanne is best part of all. New Year’s Eve walking, cuddling, feeding off each others energy. Travel stresses and frustrations easier simply by being with her. She is an anxious worrier but really do see her getting better

Traveling is fun, stressful, expensive, schedule shaking. Things beyond control are tough to manage, but when managed with others, it’s not too bad.

### Reflections

- parents stress levels and particularities. They have always been particular, however they seemed much better about enjoying themselves and having fun.
- Jeanne is great travel partner. She does get easily bothered by things, as do most people. She is full of energy and lust for experiences and the only one to really keep up with me in many aspects. Really enjoyed her saying we are going to suspension bridge. Pushing me to say something after old lady nancy cut in line
- lack of diversity was very apparent being older and with jeanne. Really shows inequality on global scale. Lots of conflicting feeling on service and enjoying at expense worldwide
- Expectations really played factor as we all looked forward to trip for so long. Jeanne and family really wanted to connect, with many activities and situations that weren’t ideal it was hard for things to play out as expected. All you can do is best you can.
- Always have emergency cash and be prepared for things. There is a balance to preparation and travel.
