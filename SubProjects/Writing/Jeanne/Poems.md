# Poems for Jeanne

## 11/24

My heart didn't tell me, the day it skipped a beat  
for it was too excited, I'd been swept off my feet  
looking back it seems we've grown so quick  
I truly feel this was no choice or pick

life has flown by with a beat of its own,  
sometimes so fast, its felt like a loan  
if each day is so precious, how come some are less  
in moments without you, I'm not quite a mess  

For I get much done and enjoy the simple me  
all the independence in the world, yet I don't feel free  
I could be a peasant or lord of all the lands  
I just need my heavy heart in your hands  

I need to feel needed, and encouraged more
our activites are repeated, but never a bore
a piece of work, but never a chore
I love you know and forever more

## When you

when your eyes twinkle
and you smile with glee
when your cheeks wrinkle
and you laugh with me

when you crack a joke
neither good nor funny
when you finger poke
or ask for honey

when you light my world
in the midst of night
when life's unfurled
or somehow your right

when your heart halts
for it feels too much
when it's neither of our faults
or pierced by loves touch

when you choose the red pill
or leave open the door
when you love them still
and have never wanted more

when you make me question and contemplate
or feel a moment that must be fake
when you're the only one that can relate
and want to give more than you can take

when you're not you
or project on me
when your feeling blue
or think I don't care or see

when push turns to shove
or like turns to love
when your heart is on your sleeve
or simply wont let me leave

when your more than I need
for your all the above
when your too happy to heed
you understand my love



## Another

I once heard a story of a girl and a boy  
they acted like children, covetting with coy  
the boy felt so likely, it didn't feel real  
the girl felt so deeply, that crazy zeal 

they connected so quickly, it's like they'd lost touch  
although they knew nothing, they simply felt too much  
the boy was overwhelmed, afraid to screw up something so great  
the girl stayed guarded, for love wouldn't decide her fate  

obstacles came from the world and within  
nothing could break apart the natural grin  
everyime I look at her, I sink lower in my seat  
overwhelmed with feelings stuck on repeat

I'm used to control and running from pain  
but running from this is missing all there is to gain  
I know what I want, for learning takes time  
any pain I've caused it feels like a crime

My love is unhindered, it knows no doubt
it's unwaverying, instinctual, and will make it's own route
it's vulnerable, it's honest, it's curious to see
how can something so simple, be everything to me
