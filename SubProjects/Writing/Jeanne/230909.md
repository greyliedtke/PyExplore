## Song 
the opposite of simple, the definition of sweet
the reason for my dimple, the picker of every treat

easily discouraged when in trouble or in need
but once times get real, she's my trusty steed

self dubbed the darkest horse
banking three's from the bench
a small but mighty force
die high makes booties quench

when you need a hand to hold
or they're simply getting cold
mine are always there
like corn at the state fair

once we were together
once we were apart
now we live together
it all just melts my heart

I feel so deeply from all the little things
it's the perfect symbol for how a bee stings
from tensions playing pickle ball
learn to win together and also fall

just like the fork, that fell with no apology
starting to feel like a case study of anthropology
it’s not about the fork, it’s the fork in the road
only person i'd pick to paint the porch at my abode

a person that would walk a couple miles in flip flops
or carry gallons of milk to the hill tops
making friends and fam walk with her, though they need to stop and rest
somethings you can't say no to, like wingstop and the best

from jokes and giggle moments, to roasts that cut too deep
furnishing cities from by nothing, until i say boop beep

my everything and nothing, she teaches me nam jai
happy birthday jeanne bay, I'm such a lucky guy
