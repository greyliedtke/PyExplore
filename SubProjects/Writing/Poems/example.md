# A wonder why

Often times, I am filled with **doubt**  
not in myself, rather something far **out**  
I wish I could grasp it, and bring it **close**  
but it's stronger than a single **dose**  

I can't quite conjure what I want to **say**   
all I can do, is let the feelings go **fray**  
I want to teach and talk of the **world**  
but lately it's felt ever **unfurled**

## Here again
Do you get now what I'm trying to say  
I thought I was clear, but it seems not ok  
I once had a vision, one without doubt  
now all I feel is a world without  
I search through the pain  
I listen with an ear   
but what I once had, was all held to near  
I need to realize and I need to get through  
all of these visions aren't visions to you

Reflection  
Need it for direction  
Too much can make you doubt  
Not enough be on the wrong route
