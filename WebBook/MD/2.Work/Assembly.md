# Assembly

Putting pieces together has always been a satisfying task. It may be humans innate sense of building. Whether this stems from the first building blocks of society to the sky scrapers of new york, we are destined to understand. We yearn to push limits and grow to as high as we can reach. 

This kit will not take you as high as you can reach, for you will go much further than this kit can provide. However, it will provide you with the key building blocks to understand microcontrollers, sensors, LED's and the basics of programming.
