### Main

- A documented hands on project for beginners to 

This is not a website. This is not a book. This is a web book. 

My intentions for creating this book seem to grow with each word I write. I want to teach people about science. I want to give people an approachable hands on experience learning about the art behind science. We tend to associate learning with school or being forced to do something we don't care about. There's a chance you are reading this because it is an assignment or your parent thought they picked out a great gift. Maybe a special someone had you in mind. Or maybe you are a dedicated individual that wants to learn!

Regardless of the path that took you here, you are here. To give an overview of what you will be learnning, I have broken it down into several sections.


### Ideas

- stories on software

A walk through history on the development of computing. This book aims to take the reader in a hands on journey of learning computers. First we will begin with one of the first instances of the power of computing. A famous code that blah blah blah. 

### Examples / animations
- Menu Screen
- Pi Pico... Wifi
- wave animations
- Tetris
- Pictures
- Etch a Sketch
- Enigma
