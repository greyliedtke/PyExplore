# Lessons gleamed from Book
[Antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile_(book)) by Nassim Nicholas Taleb

## Heuristics
Enable a person to learn/discover something on their own. Trial and Error. Tinkerers
- Egyptian wheel invented as toy before used as tool
- Bigger picture can blind of small innovations. Suitcase wheel took forever to invent
- Those with free time -hobbyists, reverends, and tinkers had significant technology contributions.

## Latrogenics
Unintended consequences. Treatment causes more harm than benefits. Very common in modern medicine/personal doctors.
- Importance of allowing nature to play course sometimes. Bodies strenghten from stress, bacteria, fasting, variety
- Social networks make anti-social. Wealth can cause more worries.
- Chemotherapy discovered after mustard fumes from ship blown up in ww2
- WW2 Fueled technology advances. Cold War fueled internet
- Companies that began as making something else. Amazon books, ferrari tractors? kevlar, etc. 
- "wind extinguishes a flame but energizes a fire"

## Ethics
- Decimate - Roman military discipline where 1/10 soldiers executed as form of punishment
- Roman/ British Engineers - Stand with family underneath built bridges
- Code of Hammurabi - Babylonian (mesopotamia) code of law. Punishment equal to damage. Doctors responsible for damage to patient
- Corrupt business, managers, gov. People that have options to gain but no risk. Gov workers who move to private companies to skirt system
- Burn one's boats - burn boats to eliminate option of turning back. Commit to point of no return. 
- Tariq- "Behind you is the sea, before you, the enemy. You have left now only the hope of your courage and your constancy"
- "ethical life isn't so when stripped of personal risks"

## Miscelanneous
- Entrepenaurs and business risk takers essential. Not all can succeed. Need failures. Brave
- Fallacy of not kill you makes you stronger. Just the weak die out
- Fallacy of research to innovation. Vast majority of drugs created by private companies
- Barbell strategy - Invest in extremes: low risk, stable, and high risk volatile. Importance of variety
- Issue of using models to predict everything, somethings cannot be predicted, variables ignored
- Wealth isn't necessarily money. Importance of freedom and agency
- Unhappy people that write books on happiness. Man that claimed 50k is more than enough for anyone was stingy lol
- Fasting release different hormones. More natural. Lions don't eat before hunting... Reward workouts with food. Desired isn't always available
- Some people are meant to follow news and media. Scholars are meant to read. Engineers tinker. Act accordingly
- That which has lasted through time is antifragile and will last. Reading and writing will always be around. 
- Importance of walking. Mental, body, hormones, natural movement need. 
- Let those who do, talk. Importance of understanding every part of process if going to manage. Similar to engineering. Washing going to war, bush played videogames
- Socrates famous for questions. Put to death for disrupting system. Critical thinking, however some things are instinctual and no need to define 
- Accepting death. Not meant to live forever, so when we go, we accept. French saying place aux autres -  make room for others
- Obvious decisions need no more than a single reason
- switch that kills the individual when in a crowd. Operating as mass
- Education and "prestige" that comes with it. Not as valuable as it really is. Much can be learned on ones own
- “He who has never sinned is less reliable than he who has only sinned once. And someone who has made plenty of errors—though never the same error more than once—is more reliable than someone who has never made any.”
- “Further, my characterization of a loser is someone who, after making a mistake, doesn’t introspect, doesn’t exploit it, feels embarrassed and defensive rather than enriched with a new piece of information, and tries to explain why he made the mistake rather than moving on. These types often consider themselves the “victims” of some large plot, a bad boss, or bad weather.”
