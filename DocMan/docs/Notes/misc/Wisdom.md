## Philosophy

- Your experience in life is dictated by your mindset. It is the most important thing you have and it is the one thing you have complete power of.
- Always ask what you want, why you want it, and how your going to get it.
- Work the body so the mind can rest.
- Feed your mind. But to do so you must feed the body! Enjoy food!
- All we have is today. But it's okay, cause we also have tomorrow
- Everyone’s trying to find somebody, nobody’s trying to be somebody

## Learning

- Don't stress, ask questions, admit your faults. Failure is learning.
- Confidence is key. To gain confidence, practice. Pascual is a nerdy engineer, but he has practiced to be a beast. Construct with criticism.
- Think hard before saying yes to things. Etc: girls trips

## Gratitude

- Don't take it too seriously. Have fun, be happy, and enjoy everything you can. One day it will all be gone.

## Giving

- Compliment others and make them feel good. The world may pull you down, but we have the power to pick ourselves up.
- One of the best feelings is making somebody else happy.
- If you want to connect with someone, relate to them. Ask things that are deep, gold is found with dynamite.
- Talk to strangers and fill your life with those tiny moments. A tiny moment with a stranger goes a long way.
- Friends are meant to be your friends. Talk to them, open up, they want to be there for you.
