## Aperture

- **large aperture = smaller number = more light = shallow DOF = more blur**
- The aperture is simply the opening within the lens that limits the amount of light that can pass through it. By changing the aperture value, you increase or decrease the size of that opening, thereby allowing more or less light into the camera.
- measured in f-stops, such as f/16 and f/4
- The smaller the f-stop number, the larger the opening, and vice versa. So, when you are adjusting the settings, think of the opposite:
- less light to enter is a larger f-stop
- lens maximum aperture will be part of its model name
- Determines depth of field (DOF)
- large DOF will have sharp focus from foreground to background
- while a small DOF sees the focus concentrated on one particular plane, with foreground and background elements blurred away

## Shutter speed

- **faster speed = less blur = less light**
- measured in fractions of second
- slower speed, need more stable
- 1/60 to 1/125 safe for handheld shots

## ISO

- **youâ€™ll want to keep ISO as low as possible while still achieving the correct exposure, as increasing the ISO also increases noise**
- international organization for standardization
- relates how shutter speed corresponds to light let in
- A high ISO leads to a brighter image, whereas a low ISO will be darker.
- does not reflect any sort of real-world measurement
- Most cameras start at ISO 100 or 200, and can be set up to 12,800 or higher.
- The math is, fortunately, simple: Double the ISO, and you double the brightness
- first two have creative side effects (DOF, motion blur)
