## Things to work on


- [x] PID page for engine
    - save vars in redis
    - simulator?
  
- pcb for common mode choke
- instrumentation list strategy
- managing tests wiki


## talking points

- PID improvements
  - very cool
  - try on ngc trailer
- commmon mode choke
  - high amperage pcb trouble
  - 3d print fixture to hold all in place
- greg choke sizing spreadsheet
  - making sense of everything
  - conclusion ---> may not be possible with 
  - OCC rectifier not able to correct for PF
  - choke reduces voltage seen at terminals, that is why NGC rewired in series
  - calculating power 
- fiber ethernet
-
